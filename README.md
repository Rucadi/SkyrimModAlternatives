# SkyrimModAlternatives
This is a project that aims to put together the Skyrim Mod Community and creating efforts to: 
```
1- Create a free and explorable database of existing mods
2- Create a free and community-driven alternative to download them
3- Preserve mods while avoiding takedowns or just dissapearing with the pass of time
4- Decentralized system, all this code can run in any computer and anyone can use this software, it's opensource and based on the webtorrent project. 
```
# This tool does not endorse piracy
Modders usually work as a hobby, others do plan to earn money doing what they love. 
Some platforms pay them for their downloads, some don't, but at the end of the day, it's their work. 

You may contribute to the database using information from mods that does not have permission to be reuploaded.

For such mods, no TorrentHash will be uploaded to the database until the Author gives their explicit permission, 
making them searchable through the database but not downloadable.
